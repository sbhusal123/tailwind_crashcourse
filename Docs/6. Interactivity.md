# Interactivity (Hover, Focus, ...)

- [Tailwind Docs: Hover Focus, Other States](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#hover-focus-and-active)


**Few Classes:**
- `hover:<util-class>` for handling effect on hover.
- `focus:<util-class>` for handling focus effect. Focus can be debugged from element inspector.
- `active:<class>` when button is active.
- `<breakpoint>:hover:<util-class>` for hover effects in different states. Example: ``sm:hover:bg-red-500``

**Tips:**

1. For any transforms to work with hover, a class should also have `transform` class in html element.

```html
<a class="hover:bg-indigo-400 hover:-translate-y-1 transform transition" href="#">
    Book your escape
</a>
```

> The transform class is applied to the button to establish the base for the translation.

> Transition property is for animation, for more see the docs below.

2. Transition Property works for controlling the css transitions.

> Use the `transition-*` utilities to specify which properties should transition when they change.
