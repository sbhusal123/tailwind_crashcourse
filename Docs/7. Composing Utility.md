# Composing Utilities

When we have too bulky classes in some html elements, we can use `@apply` utility. Read more [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply)

More about directives and functions [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#tailwind)


For example: We've a bulky class here:

```html
<div class="mt-4 sm:mt-6">
    <a 
        class="inline-block focus:outline-none focus:ring focus:ring-offset-2 
        focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:ring-opacity-5 active:bg-indigo-600
        px-5 py-3 transition duration-1000 rounded-lg shadow-lg bg-indigo-500
        hover:bg-indigo-400 hover:-translate-y-0.5 transform text-white
        uppercase font-semibold text-sm sm:text-base" href="#"
    >
        Book your escape
    </a>
</div>
```

We can move it into a single class with apply by using:


```css
/* ./css/style.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;

.btn {
    @apply inline-block focus:outline-none focus:ring focus:ring-offset-2 
    focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:ring-opacity-5 active:bg-indigo-600
    px-5 py-3 transition duration-1000 rounded-lg shadow-lg bg-indigo-500
    hover:bg-indigo-400 hover:-translate-y-0.5 transform text-white
    uppercase font-semibold text-sm sm:text-base;
}

@tailwind utilities;
```

Note that we have ``active:bg-indigo-600`` being used in the above so, it's important we define the extended variants for active as:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      backgroundColor: ['active']
    }
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

> Note that rebuilding with postcss is required as we are using a build version of tailwind here.

[More about variants](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/configuring-variants)

`npx tailwindcss-cli build -i ./css/style.css -o ./css/custom_button.css` use `--watch` flag for debug.

## Caveats with Composing Utilities:


```css
/* ./css/style.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

.btn {
    @apply inline-block focus:outline-none focus:ring focus:ring-offset-2 
    focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:ring-opacity-5 active:bg-indigo-600
    px-5 py-3 transition duration-1000 rounded-lg shadow-lg bg-indigo-500
    hover:bg-indigo-400 hover:-translate-y-0.5 transform text-white
    uppercase font-semibold text-sm sm:text-base;
}
```

In case of above, if `.btn` class were to be defined below utilities definition, it wont work properly, cause some of the utilities classes are being used in the class with `@apply`.

> It can also be defined other way with `@layout`




```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
  .btn {
      @apply inline-block focus:outline-none focus:ring focus:ring-offset-2 
      focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:ring-opacity-5 active:bg-indigo-600
      px-5 py-3 transition duration-1000 rounded-lg shadow-lg bg-indigo-500
      hover:bg-indigo-400 hover:-translate-y-0.5 transform text-white
      uppercase font-semibold text-sm sm:text-base;
  }

  .btn-primary {
    @apply ....
  }

  .btn-secondary {
    @apply ....
  }  
} 
```

Here, since we are defining the custom class for component layer, it's placed inside the components layer.

More docs about the layout directive can be found [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#layer)

It's always better to avoid the duplication in classes, so we can further reduce the classes definition to:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;

@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
    /* common styles moved here */
    .btn {
        @apply inline-block focus:outline-none focus:ring focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-opacity-5
        px-5 py-3 transition duration-100 rounded-lg shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-0.5 transform text-white
        uppercase font-semibold text-sm sm:text-base;
    }

    /* styles for primary button */
    .btn-primary {
        @apply focus:ring-indigo-500 active:bg-indigo-600 bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-400
    }

    /* styles for secondary button */
    .btn-secondary {
        @apply focus:ring-gray-500 active:bg-gray-600 bg-gray-500 hover:bg-gray-400
    }
}
```
